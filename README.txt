A plugin-agnostic block theme starter for bus ticket / carrier ticketing websites.

== Description ==

MT Tickets is a modern WordPress block theme (Full Site Editing) designed as a clean visual foundation for ticketing projects, such as bus and carrier ticket sales.

Important: This theme intentionally contains NO ticket selling logic. The ticketing functionality should be implemented via a separate plugin, and that plugin should be able to work with other themes as well.

This theme focuses on:
* A clear header structure (top bar, header bar, hero area)
* A structured footer with multiple columns and a bottom menu area
* A design token approach via theme.json for consistent typography, spacing, and colors

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mt-tickets` folder to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory, or install via Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme.
2. Activate the theme through Appearance > Themes.
3. Open Appearance > Editor to customize header, footer, and global styles.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does MT Tickets include ticket sales functionality? =
No. MT Tickets is a theme only. Ticket sales logic should be provided by a plugin.

= Can I use the ticketing plugin with another theme? =
Yes. The plugin should be theme-independent by design.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial release: block theme skeleton, base templates, template parts, and theme.json.
